# rep guidance from course guide

(Have emailed Damien to check if I can use 2 colum layout on Monday 15th March - awauting reply from him to see if okay!)

All project work should finish by week 24. The student will be given a further 3-4 weeks (depending on the Easter holiday dates) to write the final version of their report, which should be at maximum 20 pages long. The report is an in-depth account of a detailed piece of scientific work, and should be tailored to suit the individual project. Students should discuss the style, content and level of theirreport with their supervisor. The report should integrate the material in the technical essay carried out at the beginning of the project. This will provided a summary of the professional literature in the chosen area, including a critical comparison ofthe material presented. This will be followed by a written analysis of the work carried out in the project, in which the aims of the project, research method, results, discussion and conclusions are clearly shown. A critical evaluation of the significanceof the work, in the context of the literature survey carried out should also be provided. The project report should contain an abstract of the work performed, of length around 250 words, in the accepted scientific format and should contain a detailed listof references at the end. The project work will be assessed by the project Supervisor and the report will be assessed by an independent staff member.

4. 40% assessment (**16 credits**)- project report - **Due 26th March**
   - 20 pages MAX
   - make a nice overleaf template (make Chris a collaborator)
   - Chris wants a final draft submitted to him 2 weeks before deadline which is the Friday of the oral pres week so should really be prepping pres and report simultaneously in late feb (having the lit review section already covered over xmas)
   - overall 1/3rd lit survey, 1/3rd methodology, 1/3rd results (make refs nice and tight)
     - IGR uses Vanvouver refs i think
   - only matric number and project title in report (does matric number include letter?)
   - mark breakdown:
     - 80% (**13 creds**) refs, - (correct choice in setting context) pres+figs - (captions, professional layout, readable) structure - (all sections in correct order and of balanced length) writing - (concise english with few typos, correct capitisation for abbrevs etc) **NOTE** 80% of all project marks come from how the doc looks, the refs,m fig choice/layout and no typos/ sentence structure. Can literally do all this from significant proofreading alone! dont leave till last minute at all, get the techpaper in on time but slowly gather intro layout
   - 20% (**3 creds**) technical content (well-informed, good depth/breadth of knowledge - this comes from the intro section where i go wide but then quickly go deep)


# Bits I need to focus on:

*This will provided a summary of the professional literature in the chosen area, including a critical comparison ofthe material presented.*
*A critical evaluation of the significanceof the work, in the context of the literature survey carried out should also be provided.*


*All sections are correctly placed of a length that produces a balanced overall document.*

*References were used to set the performed work into context.*
